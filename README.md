# Stack Array Implementation in Java

This repository contains a Java implementation of a stack using an array. The stack supports the following operations:
- **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove and return the top element from the stack.
- **Peek**: Return the top element without removing it.
- **isEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty.
- **isFull**: Check if the stack is full.
- **Display**: Print all elements in the stack.
- **Size**: Return the capacity of the stack.

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/StackArray-Implementation.git
